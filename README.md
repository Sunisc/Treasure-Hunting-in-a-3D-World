# Treasure Hunting in a 3D World w/ Binaural Audio

I developed a simple treasure hunting game using Blueprints in Unreal Engine. I've also incorporated 3D audio, with proper occlusion, reverb and spatialization. Essentiall the treasures play a hymn as you get closer to them.

Just clone and run the project. See if you can find all the treasures in under 20 seconds :D
